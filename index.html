        <p>Greg graduated from Brown University with a degree in Biology.  However, he never got to use it, instead going into database administration and reporting.  Now he is currently studing Full-Stack Web Development at UCLA Extensions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He lives in Rosemead, CA (which is entirely too far of a drive from his coding bootcamp but he makes the daily drive regardless) with his sassy cat, Pepper.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>His interests include movies, gaming, pina-coladas and getting caught in the rain.  </p>
